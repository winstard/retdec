## ELFIO

A clone of the [ELFIO](https://github.com/serge1/ELFIO) library with some bug fixes.
The concrete version (tag, commit, etc.) used as a base for our modifications is indeterminate.

## Status

This state is temporary. If possible, modifications made in the sources should be merged into the original repository. The original repository should be used here instead.

`CMakeLists.txt` should also be added to the original repository, so it is possible to use the `elfio` CMake target.
